***When a Database is Needed:***

User registration/login – store usernames, passwords (hashed), etc.

Accounts – maintain account balances, account numbers.

Transactions – record deposits, withdrawals, transfers.

Audit logs – keep track of what users did and when.

Reports – generate statements, summaries, etc.

***When a Database Might Not Be Needed:***

If it’s a purely demo app with no persistence at all.

If you're just testing APIs and don't need to store anything.

If you're using in-memory storage like HashMap or H2 for temporary testing.

🗂️ What is HashMap?
It's a Java data structure, not a database.

Stores data in key-value pairs, like a dictionary.

Example: map.put("user1", "John Doe");

In-memory only – once the app stops, all data is gone.

Best for temporary or small-scale testing.

✅ Good for: fast lookups, mock data during development.
❌ Not good for: real applications that need to persist data.

🛢️ What is H2?
H2 is an in-memory SQL database (but can also run in file mode).

It supports SQL just like MySQL/PostgreSQL.

Often used for testing or small apps in Spring Boot.

In-memory mode: data is lost when app stops.

File mode: data is saved to disk, so it persists.

✅ Good for:

Prototyping.

Running integration tests.

Tiny apps with lightweight data needs.

📦 How Much Data Can They Store?
HashMap:
Limited by your system’s RAM.

Can store millions of items if memory allows, but not suitable for persistence.

H2:
Also limited by available memory in in-memory mode.

In file mode, it can handle GBs of data, but not as scalable as MySQL/PostgreSQL.
